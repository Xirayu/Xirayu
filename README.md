# Another Story - Inspired by Maya from Arcaea

Starlight climbed upon her cheek, reflecting upon her short hair, white as the first snow. She was the second maiden born beneath the starlight.

Before her, many "Dream Weavers" had walked upon this land named WentUrc. Not long ago, this harmonious world, woven from countless pure intentions, finally welcomed its first note of "Dissonance." Thus, a clear boundary separated the tranquil Soul-Flow from violent grief.

The eternally gentle sky of Spirit Winds had been lit up twice; two lives drifted from beyond the heavens, falling like meteors, piercing through the veil of thoughts to arrive here. If you ask me, she is like the reverse side of a coin, the other face of the maiden who descended here before her.

The sky was dotted with deep purple Aether, with no trace of clouds or moon, only the silent silhouettes of floating islands.

When she first woke up, Xirayu could not see her surroundings clearly. Tears obscured her vision. Consciousness and sensation had only just returned when grief struck like an overwhelming sea, causing her to cover her face in agony.

Those large, soft animal ears drooped weakly, pressed almost flat against her hair. Tears flowed uncontrollably—in this world where "Mind is Truth," her shattered soul instantly triggered a collapse of the surrounding reality.

Every visitor to the world of WentUrc welcomes their own rebirth—here, having "nothing" does not exist, for as long as one has a "Heart," one possesses everything. But this world was too "perfect" for her—since "The End of All Things," her heart had long been riddled with holes.

After all, she had suffered irreversible damage; thus, even though the surrounding Spirit Winds poured their utmost effort into soothing her scars, it was ultimately to no avail. This was her misfortune: in a world where everyone could "Manifest" happiness, she seemed only able to manifest despair.

She did not actually reject the darkness. In the closed loop of a dead silence, she felt at ease instead.

Occasionally, golden beams of light would flash through the darkness, escaping from nearby "Telepathic Conduit Arrays"—the physical forms of others' joy. But in her eyes, these were hideously ugly things, serving only to sting and displease her eyes.

Whenever laughter rang out from the nearby "Phantom Art Gardens," or melodious Spirit Songs drifted from distant floating islands, whether it was the tiny, fragmented notes or the deep tremors of the earth resonating in sympathy, her sensitive, fluffy ears would instinctively tremble, as if a sharp storm was screaming in them, growing ever more intense.

If anything stole away the night and silence she loved, the cradle of memory would hold her up. Even if she did not belong to this world, the World Will of WentUrc—that vast, gentle Soul-Flow—loved her incomparably.

This peculiar girl loved to sleep and cry; her petite frame, short pale hair, and those unique ears made her look like a small beast that had lost its way. She wore a blue and white dress that seemed out of place with this heavy sorrow; the hem was as light as the sky, yet the pale yellow flower decorations at her waist swayed with her trembling.

WentUrc pitied her and tried to "Resonate" with her, but unfortunately, she did not care much for these kindnesses that adored her. She feared these glittering "Mind Crystals" because she preferred the tranquility and depth of the endless night.

To her, who made the world her home, the high heavens were her dome, but at that time, she desperately needed a "hiding place": benevolent thoughts surged like a tide from all directions, trying to heal her, never ceasing, and she simply could not bear the disturbance.

Amid the shadows of Gothic towers and the illusions of ruins, Xirayu enjoyed a moment of respite, using the chance to understand the quiet corner she was in—this had become her habit, to familiarize herself with every cave in this world that could insulate her against "Resonance."

In truth, even so, the omnipresent gentle magic was hard to block completely, but it was relatively easier to endure: without the dazzling iridescence of the floating islands, this place did not refract much light, and she neither could nor wanted to understand what lay within those beautiful thoughts.

She would cross mountains and rivers to find absolute silence; to stay away from that pervasive "healing," she dared to climb the highest floating islands and tread into the deepest forests. She walked and walked, walked and walked... until one day, stepping out of a dim passage constructed by her own subconscious, she finally saw the boundary between reality and mental imagery not far ahead. She stopped.

Actually... the sounds she heard were the hysterical screams of people, and the scenes she saw were the culprits. Bright pillars of light descended from the heavens, tearing the earth apart: her old home was destroyed.

How she wished the pain would last only a few seconds, but in reality, it was a torture that lasted for hours. It was too painful, it hurt so much, so much...

She recognized the people on the other side of the world, understanding that they should all be dead. She heard someone commanding her, freezing her in place, but that voice soon dissipated. All her connections, all her bonds with that passed world, turned to nothingness in that slow and ruthless disaster.

She lost everything, only then waking up in WentUrc, still all alone. Looking out, the horizon of this world, which should have been a soft dawn, was dyed crimson by her mental imagery, resembling a sunset, or rather, a sea of fire.

Finally, tormented by countless auditory and visual hallucinations, Xirayu knelt at the exit of the passage. Sharp pain pierced her heart like a blade, making her weep, making her wail, making her nauseous. In this world where thought is reality, her pain materialized; unbearable panic struck the surrounding tranquility like waves of black thorns, endless, and the most unbearable part of it pressed upon her like a boulder, suffocating her.

The pathetic fact that made her life worse than death reminded her again and again: "I am still here." Her pain, her grief, was silent yet deafening, even causing turbulence in the surrounding Spirit Winds. WentUrc heard everything and felt this violent "Negative Resonance."

She was now at an edge, sitting at the junction of self-closure and the open world. The voices in her head did not stop, tearing at her eardrums, clamoring. Her large, deep eyes stared blankly into the distance, begging that she no longer needed to think, no longer needed to "Manifest" anything.

It was too late; the mistake had been made, the tragedy had been brewed. No matter how much pain and loss were caused, they had all become history. Time cannot flow backward; the past cannot be changed. But... is there really nothing that can be done? Can her tears be wiped away, her scars smoothed?

A "Plume of Will," condensed from pure benevolence, floated down from above, slowly coming to her side. Two plumes, three... more and more, like glowing drizzle, eventually forming a cocoon-like barrier constructed by "Dream Weaving Arts," isolating her from the overly blinding light of hope, granting her the dimness and embrace she desired.

Calm her noisy thoughts? No, that won't do. Distract her? Or perhaps coax her gently? Her attention was already very scattered. What to do? What should be done...

The Plumes of Will darkened uncharacteristically. To match her state of mind, the barrier they formed began to fold downward like delicate, soft cloud-woven fabric, until it completely wrapped her up. It was truly laughable; how could magical energy feel like a soft entity? But strangely, Xirayu raised her head.

Those animal ears, which had been drooping, twitched slightly. Although she flinched, she eventually looked up... she saw the things reflected in this barrier: not the happiness of others, but memories gently reconstructed.

The protagonists of the memories held in the barrier were others; she saw the sadness and pain they carried, saw the mistakes people had made. WentUrc had no memories of war to show her, so it showed her the spiritual dilemmas its residents once faced, and she watched quietly.

There were no rivers of blood, no mountains of blades or seas of fire, no hail of bullets. There were only painful, lonely, and helpless people, weeping silently in the "Clean Tea Dream Circle," searching for lost chapters in the "Memory Library." Yes, for a terminal illness like loneliness, even in a magical world, how could there be a cure?

She pondered. She saw people of all kinds, men and women, young and old, all conversing with the shadows in their hearts. She saw those who had once lost themselves smiling weakly, clutching fading Mind Crystals that represented things passed.

This is what the world wanted to convey to her: You feel you will never be happy again. You feel you might as well give up. But why must it be so?

The past is indeed past; its brand will not disappear. However, some, or perhaps most "brands," are actually shackles you placed upon yourself. Are you not still alive? That world was indeed destroyed, but your heart still beats here. And in WentUrc, where the heart beats, there is the world.

"Please... Stay." "'Stay'...?" A whisper answered another whisper—this was the first time she had spoken since coming to this world, conveying her voice through "Mind-Sense." Although her voice sounded very hoarse due to the dryness and pain in her throat, although she only repeated part of the whisper of the World Will she perceived with a barely audible sound.

She gritted her teeth hard, her childish and cute face twisting with pain. This world had given her much love... This gentle cradle named WentUrc... And her response to this was only resentment.

Her gaze became sharp, glaring at the barrier made of Plumes of Will before her. The scenes in the barrier shifted with the flow of energy: WentUrc changed as it detected the shift in her state of mind. Now, the gloomy or gentle soothing emotions were cast aside...

The Ocean of Mind rippled, no longer stable as if impacted. Xirayu looked at those memories—there was a man, looking back at himself in the mirror, attempting to reshape his face with "Manifestation Arts," yet seeing only darkness before his eyes. There was a woman, standing by the sea of Silver Vines at night, her feet immersed in the Galaxy Water that constantly lapped against her. There was a child, dressed in a black formal gown; her sister was preparing to cast "Heart-Link" to take her arm, but was slapped away impatiently.

Xirayu smiled. It was a silent yet unrestrained smile. These scenes seemed to be trying to resonate with her; thinking about it felt pathetic. These scenes were indeed resonating with her.

These attempts, these actions... She really wanted to spit fiercely at this gentle air. As her broken and twisted heart shattered further, the pain the world perceived from her grew stronger. The surrounding magical elements began to flip over one by one, gathering and closing in on her—more and more, brighter and brighter...

They began to show her how those people's inner worlds fell apart step by step. The suffering, struggles, and failures of others flashed by, gripping her heart tightly. Out-of-control mental power climbed up her limbs like poisonous vines, spreading, bending, twisting, wrapping around her tightly like malicious chains and tightening constantly, until the sharp branches finally pressed against her fragile neck.

But she just sneered. That weak heart that kept beating, did not belong to her at all.

The air trembled, as if the entire space shuddered. The light in the barrier extinguished in an instant, and the chains of mental power binding the maiden tightened, squeezing her body. Suddenly, the night flickered. A twisted, violent cyclone of Spirit Wind swept past rapidly. The magical shackles around her shattered instantly into countless specks of light.

She fell to the ground, her blue and white skirt spreading out, able to bathe once again in the gentle morning glow of the distant dawn—that was WentUrc's eternal light of healing. Xirayu looked up at the pitch-black sky, then looked down at the bright cluster of floating islands in the distance, and then closed her eyes.

"Why...? Confusion, anger, loss." The warm light hit her shoulders, warming her body. These emotions poured unreservedly into her trembling hands, clenched into fists. But soon, she no longer felt warm. She carefully opened her eyes again, looking into the surrounding darkness.

At this moment, WentUrc found her again and formed a brand new high wall. Shadow and radiance, they formed a brand new passage. At the end of that passage was scattered sunlight, composed of the wishes of countless people.

Xirayu propped herself up, looking half-risen at that distant point of light. The memories of the past no longer assaulted her mind. She looked back and saw the huge gap she had just walked out of a few minutes ago—it was a reality void caused by her inner collapse, deeper and more bottomless than before, like a yawning great mouth. Something flickered faintly in that pitch-black mass—unformed Mind Crystals, presumably; what else could they be?

Caught between two choices, she was forced to think once again. A choice had to be made. A choice always has to be made. Either let the comfortable void swallow you whole, or actively embrace that terrifying, overly real "Soul-Flow."

Xirayu knelt on both knees, thinking. The wind blew past her furry ears, bringing a hint of chill. "What exactly do you want me to do? Face everything, or just give up?" she asked angrily. Answering her was another question. She could faintly hear that voice; it was the resonance of the world with her soul. It asked: What do you want?

To this, her answer was... previously, she felt she could at least answer this question. For example, "I want to quiet my complicated thoughts." Or perhaps, "I want to forget all of this." "I want to disappear from this world." "I want to feel pain." "I want to be hurt by others." "I want to become happy." ...Now, when facing this question again, she felt that one of the answers she gave back then might still be correct.

She remembered not just the "Ending." She remembered everything she had experienced. That short life was mostly happy, but precisely because of that, this loss appeared particularly heavy. And the guilt... the feeling that she was the one who took everything away would torture her forever.

She remained silent, casting her gaze forward again. You can choose to use "Manifestation Arts" to become happy, but that false happiness is not what you deserve. You can also choose to accept judgment, but it terrifies you. When you are in this dilemma, you only feel that you actually have no right to choose.

However, assuming you must make a choice, assuming you can really see two clear but different paths laid out before you, instead of walking blindly down one road into the dark, at this moment... What choice will you make?

The era of uncertain paths is over. The era of drift and pity is history; the era created single-handedly by a fool has passed. The field of view is no longer narrow, and the clouds flying across half the sky have become thin. The starlight dimmed, and the sunlight was no longer bright.

Her greatest wish while bound was to suffer torment on a cliff of despair, but such a wish would not come true. On the contrary, she gained the right to choose. Because this is what WentUrc wanted to see—every soul able to freely play its own movement, even if it is a tune of sorrow.

She stood up. Before her was a high wall built of Mind Intent. The light on the wall began to dim, and fragments of memories no longer appeared within it. What this mirror could reflect now was her own face.

She looked at her reflection in the mirror—her short hair like moonlight, those tall animal ears—and then at the pale yellow flower decoration on her chest... To her left and right, a winding path extended from each side. The Spirit Wind brushed past her, escaping through her hair.

She felt brand new now. As if someone had finally noticed her, as if a steady hand rested gently on her back. Wanting happiness is nothing to be ashamed of... And feeling sadness is not either.

Look straight into your heart, face reality, and then make a choice. That is enough. Xirayu turned around and took the first step forward.
