(One day Tianzelle wanted the Memory Library's keeper, BayHyn, to tell a story.) 

> Hmph, you idiot Tianzelle, you actually came to bother me for a story? Fine, I'll reluctantly make the words clear for you: 

Long, long ago, on a plain gently stroked by mist and silver light, there lay a realm called the "Silver-Mist Plain." 
There, the fog hung like the gossamer a weaver maiden might scatter, softly winding around ancient treetops and desolate stone paths, and even the moonlight was quietly kneaded into countless shards of glass. 
At the edge of the mist stood a city forgotten by time, and within that city was a lantern said to be able to reveal the heart, called the "Dream Lamp." 
Legend said that on sleepless nights, if one touched the lamp's light with a fingertip, one could hear the deepest secrets whisper from within and even turn the most hidden wish into a thread of starlight. 
On the borders of that realm lived a small cat cloaked in silver-white fur, her eyes like rubies carved by frost and snow, so cold they could tint the night itself blood red. 
She did not love company nor loudness, and often sat alone upon a hill watching the distant city, as if waiting for something or keeping a silent vow. 

One day, the wind blew a yellowed map to her feet, its edges carved with ancient runes pointing the way to the Dream Lamp. 
So the little cat folded up the silence of night, slung on a pack, and set out to cross the sea of mist. 
She walked through pine woods the color of ink, hearing the roots whisper ancient tales underground. 
She crossed a wasteland strewn with ice-flowers, the snow beneath her feet chiming like silver bells, as if providing music for her journey. 
At night she slept by a campfire, and in her dreams the lamp's light would appear, as though from afar it were straightening her cloak. 
In a glade woven from dead branches she met a traveler, a person bearing a warm smile and a light step, like the first sprout of grass that unexpectedly appears in spring. 
The traveler spoke little, yet brought her warm tea when she was weary and raised a light in silence when she was lost, guarding without asking whence she came and caring only that she return. 
So they walked side by side along a road stained silver-gray by mist; the little cat remained mostly silent, while the traveler offered smiles when confusion clouded her gaze. 
The little cat grew somewhat dazed — though the distant lamp was beautiful, what truly warmed her was the shadow and breath that accompanied her along the way. 
When they finally reached the center of the dreamland and crossed that stone bridge bright with lamps, the Dream Lamp's light was not as blinding as the legends said. 
Rather, it was as gentle as a moon surrounded by countless small wishes, hanging quietly beneath the night and reflecting the unguarded faces of those who came. 
The little cat laid her hand upon the lamp's light; it flowed through her fingers like clear spring water, and she heard a soft whisper echo in the depths of her heart. 
She turned to look at the traveler, who only pursed their lips slightly and gave a sweet smile, their eyes mirroring her reflection — that reflection no longer harsh, still bearing that strand of tenderness she wouldn't admit to. 
The light remained, and the warmth in the palm of the little cat's hand ceased to feel strange. 
When morning came and she woke, she unexpectedly said "thank you" in a tsundere way. 

> (At this point BayHyn put away their usual calm, and a rare softness flashed in their eyes) You dummy, if you think this story is too simple, then I'll get angry. 

In the **Dream Land** (WentUrc), they did not instantly become the heroes or princes of legend; instead, in countless ordinary days they smoothed one another's loneliness little by little. 
There were storms, misunderstandings, and countless trivial joys, but every gloom they drank half of together, leaving the other half for tomorrow's sunlight. 
The ending did not need dazzling fireworks; the best ending was that they could still wake the next morning and continue walking side by side toward the unknown. 

> Is this the legendary story of Xirayu and IGCrystal? 

> (BayHyn murmured, unable to hold it back) You dummy, can't you see this is the story of Xirayu and IGCrystal? 

> Fine then (๑òᆺó๑)
